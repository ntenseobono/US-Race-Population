# Form of Our Website

For the website, our form will be presented vertically, starting from the top heading downward. The first option for the user is "Select what data you want to look at."
The options presented will be "Get race or total population of the US or a State", "Compare race or total populations different or Same State/Year", 
and "Filter dataset based on RACE or TOTAL population US or a State". These options will present drop downs specific to each option. From there, 
the user will be asked to select a year, showing a dropdown of 2010 or 2020. The user will then be asked to select a state of interest, showing a dropdown 
of all the US states, including Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. At the end of the page, there will be a submit button to submit all intially selected options.

# Results Page
We will have have 3 very different funtions for each respective action ("Get race or total population of the US or a State", "Compare race or total populations different or Same State/Year", and "Filter dataset based on RACE or TOTAL population US or a State"). Due to this we will have 3 results pages to avoid rendering alot of parameters and using multiple if statements to show the correct results page for what the user inputted. Doing this allows us to only check one or two parameters to know the correct results page to use render less to the respective template.
